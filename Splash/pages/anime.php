          The original anime(animated series) was released in Japan, under the translated name "Pocket Monsters". 
          It is till running till this day and releases a new season with every new generation of the game. The animated series was created with the goal of functioning as a 
          comertial for the game itself. Similiar to Yu-gi-oh, the series was created with the goal of bringing even more attention to the game itself. And, much like Yu-gi-oh
          , the original series became an enormous hit; debatebly more popular than the game itself. And with the the success of the series and game, came an unbelievable amount of 
          movies; most of which were equally successful. There have been 9 season so far of the anime, which is still ongoing. Along with over 20 different pokemon movies, who also dont plan to stop coming out any time soon.

            The majority of these films have /a certain legendary pokemon as the main focus of the movie. This is because most legendary pokemon have detailed and developed lore behind them.
            They are designed to be cool, mystic, powerful creatures with important missions/reasons for living. 
            Some of these legendaries having such huge lore, the producers cant bunch them up with the other legendaries of that generation. Instead, they warrant their own movie entirely.
            Although the majority of the fans will agree that the films slowly drop in quality as the seasons go on, this mostly has to do with Pokemon being at peek popularity when the 1st season was out.
            As a result, the series was more popular, didnt have high expectations and so the kids just ate it up.

            In all of the series, there are generally 3 main plot lines circleing around; Ashe(main charachter) try to be the very best that noone ever was, defeating whatever evil team is present in that season(team rocket in the original season) and finally, the storyline of any or all legendaries in that pokemon generation(these are usualy covered in the movies).
            Ashe derams to be the very best trainer, this means aquireing all of the regions badges and becoming champion. Meanwhile, his two friends who always acompany him, follow different goals. The girl will always be going for the regions ribbons, and the other guy is emotional support for everyone.

          The evil team of that season ussualy uses everything in their power to make Ashes journey a living hell.
          Their main goal is to always to steal pokemon, never catch them themselves. And these teams are also the main antagonists in a large amount of the movies.
          Like mentioned earlier, the legendary pokemon of each generation have their own movies. Some of these legendaries share the spotlight with other legendaries of similiar origin.
          There are certain pokemon who arent legendaries, but still have their own movies.
