      Originally released on the Game Boy, Pokemon is considered the "core-series"
      of games created by Game Freak. Published by Nintendo, the game started of in Japan and quickly blew up in
      popularity ( mostly with the kids).
      Since then Nintendo has continued to release sequels to the game every generation on each of their handhelds.
      All of the games are released in pairs, each version having small differences from the other. These
      differences are often found in the form of
      having certain pokemon only be avaliable in said game. Meaning if a kid wants to catch all of the pokemon,
      they have to socialize with other kids
      and ask them to trade said pokemon. There are currently 7 different core Pokemon games, with the eight having
      been annouced for late 2019.
      Besides the core games, there are an ungodly amount of spin-off games created in the theme of Pokemon. Everything from racing games, to puzzle games. Though most ended up being nothing but below average cash-grabs, some of these spin-offs have had great comertial success. A great example of this is the game Pokemon GO, an AR game revolving around exploring the real world and catching the Pokemon with your friends. Although its popularity wavers up and down, its garnered enough attention for users to consider it a staple in the franchise.

      The premise of the game bases itself around you, a young ambitious Pokemon trainer, exploring the regions of the Pokemon universe.
      Along the way you will compete with your rival as to who will be the greatest Pokemon trainer alive. On your journey you will meet many friends and foes, but none of that compares 
      to the bonds you will create with you Pokemon. You start each game of by choose one from 3 starters, each starter pokemon is stronger than your average pokemon, and all starter pokemon counter 1 of the other 
      starter pokemon.  Which ever one ofbthem you pick, your rival will always pick the starter that counters your starter, to make the game more challenging. No matter the generation, he starters will always be a fire, water and grass type. 
      They may have an aditional typing along with one of those 3, but there will always be one, and only one, of said types present. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Throughout any of the games, you will be guided by a professor of some sorts. This professor will be the one to give you your first starter, along with your 1st pokeballs and pokedex.
      Pokeballs are used to capture pokemon in the game. They are said to simulate the natural habitat of a pokemon inside the pokeball, so as to not be cruel to the creature.
      There are many variations of said pokeballs and the majority of the variations increase the catch rate of pokemon.
      We can differentiate 27 different balls; Beast, Cherish, Dive, Dream, Dusk, Fast, Friend, Great, Heal, Heavy, Level, Lure, Luxury, Master, 
      Moon, Nest, Net, Park, Poké, Premiere, Quick, Repeat, Safari, Sport, Timer and Ultra balls. One for each pokemon type, stat and also some generic, works the same on everyone balls.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-6 padding-1em">
    <p class="margintop-5em">
      Besides the pokeballs, the professor will give you your Pokedex. This is what you use to track all the pokemon you have caught and encountered along the way.
      One of the main achievement a player generally has when playing the games, is the goal to catch every single pokemon and completly fill the Pokedex.
      As you play the game, pokemon will start of weak and low level, so will other trainers.However, as the game progresses, both pokemon and trainers will increase in power, matching yours eventually.
      There are other many other items in the game and they can generally be divided into five groups; held items, usable items, sellable items, berrys and TMs. Most are aquired by the player finding small balls of pokeloot 
      randomly scattered across the region. Others are aquired by purchasing them at a Pokemart(store) using pokecoins. You get Pokecoins by defeating trainers. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Each region has 9 gyms, each gym lead by a gymleader whos team is built around one of the pokemon types.
      Once you defeat a gym leader, you get said gyms badge. When you have all 9 badges, you are qualified to venture down victory road and fight the elite four.
      They elite four are the strongest pokemon trainers in the region, the only one stronger than them is the champion himself. The elite four teams are also built around a certain type,
      ussually a type with higher quality pokemon associated with it. The Champion is the only trainer besides your rival who doesnt have a team built around 1 pokemon type.
      His team is generally built out of the best, highest quality pokemon. Once you beat the champ, youve effectivly beat the game.
