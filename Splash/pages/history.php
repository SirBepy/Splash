        <h2>Early Beginning</h2>
        <p class="nanum-gothic"> The history of the Pocket Monsters franchise begins over 2 decades ago. Today it is one of the most popular video game and anime franchises.

        <h2>The Creator</h2>
        <p class="nanum-gothic"> The imaginative mind behind Pokemon belongs to Satoshi Tajiri. The idea behind Pokemon is quite fascinating, as it sparked from Satoshi's child hobby. Moreover, as a child he loved to collect different bug species, as well as tadpoles in his hometown Tokyo. He wanted everyone to experience the fun he had, so he created Pokemon.</p>

          <h2>Lifelong Project</h2>
          <p class="nanum-gothic"> Along with some other friends, Tajiri formed Game Freak and much later the design studio Creatures. When his coworkers and himself found out about the Gameboy, they wanted to pitch their idea to Nintendo (Gameboy creator) so they could get funded to create the game. After several failed attempts, they were accepted and 6 years later first games were introduced.  </p>

        <p class="nanum-gothic"> Pokemon Red and Green Versions, were the first ever Pokemon games, introduced in Japan on February 27th, 1996. Satoshi Tajiri fulfilled his childhood dream and allowed everyone to catch and train 151 Pokemon. Originally, the sales were modest, but after a special event for a rare Pokemon, the market exploded and wanted more. </p>

        <h2>From Japan to the World</h2>
        <p class="nanum-gothic"> After the major success in Japan, the games were shipped all over the world. However, North America recieved Red and Blue versions, which are still popular. When the games were familiar all over the world, the anime was started, and it is a cartoon many children grew up with. From here the games only expanded, introducing new generations.</p>
