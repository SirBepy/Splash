                       <h1>Rubrics</h1>
                       <h2>Content</h2>
                       <p>The content is focused on the vast Pokemon franchise. It includes the history of the anime, games, movies and everything you need to know.</p>
                       <h2>Navigation</h2>
                       <p>The navigation is global. The navigation tags were made pixel by pixel in Photoshop and Illustrator, to resemble the Pokemon theme. It is fixed, so you always know where you are, and where you can go.</p>
                       <h2>Organization</h2>
                       <p>The organization was made simple, it was consistent on all content pages, and a timeline was added to show the history of the franchise. </p>
                       <h2>Design</h2>
                       <p>The Design was made with concentration on the red, white and black colors. This was to inspire the colors of a Pokeball. We used a timeline, quiz, carosel and animations to make the page more fun. </p>
                       <h2>HTML, CSS, JS and PHP</h2>
                       <p>Everything is valid, some code was referenced. For the JS we did preloading of the images, appearing of the boxes once you scroll to them (History page) etc. The PHP was used in most classes, however the main functions were the Quiz showing you the answers etc.</p>
